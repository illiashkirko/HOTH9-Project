# Project Overview

Where do I have lunch today? BPlate? Maybe Epicuria? Do they have vegan options? Any fish? Dining Options Selector answers all these baffling questions for you! Now you can easily get customized information about food options in dining halls at UCLA. You can choose different dates, meals, and dining halls for your search. What's more, the results can be filtered by a big variety of food restrictions (e.g. vegan menu options, food that contains soy).
